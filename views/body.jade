        h1 Hi there!
        p Thanks for visiting my <a href="http://blog.4loeser.net/2014/08/accessing-db2-from-nodejs-on-ibm.html">DB2 on IBM Bluemix</a> application. 
        p This is what I know about you and got stored in DB2:
        p Your IP address: 
          =ipinfo["ip"]
        p Your city: 
          =ipinfo["city"]
        p Your country (maybe...): 
          =ipinfo["country_name"]+'/'+ipinfo["country_code"]
        p And all what is reported: 
         =JSON.stringify(ipinfo)
