db2visitors
===========

Simple DB2 / node.js demonstration for [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net), track visitor by IP, lookup geolocation and store in [IBM DB2](www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/). The application also runs locally with a node runtime environment. It needs a private file db2cred.json to hold login information for a DB2 database. The format of that file is described in the first blog article linked below.

Most of the code is explained in the following blog articles:
