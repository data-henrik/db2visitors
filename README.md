Bluemix demo "db2visitors"
==========================
Simple DB2 / node.js demonstration for [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net), track visitor by IP, lookup geolocation and store in [IBM DB2](www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/).

# Overview
This is a simple demo combining DB2 and node.js on [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) to track visitors of a website by IP address, to lookup the geolocation for the IP address and to store the information in a [IBM DB2](www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/) database. The application can also be run locally with a node runtime environment. It needs a private file db2cred.json to hold login information for a DB2 database. The format of that file is described in the first blog article linked below.

Most of the code is explained in the following blog articles:
* [Accessing DB2 from node.js on IBM Bluemix and locally](http://blog.4loeser.net/2014/08/accessing-db2-from-nodejs-on-ibm.html)
* [Sample IBM Bluemix Application: Extended IP logging with node.js and DB2](http://blog.4loeser.net/2014/08/sample-ibm-bluemix-application-extended.html)
